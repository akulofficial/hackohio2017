# hackohio2017

This project was created as part of the Teradata Smart City Challenge at the Hack OH/IO 2017 event. The authors (Github links and/or other links to their pages will be posted at some later data) are Riya Lengade, Sruti Chigurupati, and Akul Gulrajani.

Participants in the challenge were asked to "create a solution for a smarter city" and were given data from Teradata's cuebiq database to help with this problem. Due to the sensitive nature of the data and the NDA signed, any portion of code that includes data has been redacted.
